        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently enrolled in the online Master of Computer Science program at UIUC, specializing in Data
          Science. My academic journey began at the College of William and Mary, where I graduated summa cum laude with
          a double major in Computer Science and Data Science, focusing on Data Applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by a passion for problem-solving and creativity, I started my career as a Software Engineer I at
          JPMorgan Chase through the Software Engineer Program (SEP). In this role, I am constantly challenged and
          inspired to innovate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a deep love for learning and creating and I always strive to improve my skills. I enjoy writing clean,
          efficient software and I am particulator passionate about Cloud Computing, Big
          Data, and Machine Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the realm of technology, I find joy in watching and playing sports, gardening, and playing games â€” both
          the video and board varieties.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to utilize my expertise in computer science and data science to drive positive change in
          the world. I am committed to continuous learning and aspire to push the boundaries of technology, always
          seeking new ways to make a meaningful impact on society.
